# Paper-Reading
My notes of paper reading concentrate on Robust Model Fitting, Point Cloud Registration, SLAM and maybe so on.

## Introduction
Each floder contains one paper-reading materials:
1. Paper annotated will be uploaded only when the original paper is free/open access.
2. Comments about the paper in my idea, maybe too naive.
3. If neccessary, the formula derivation will be also uploaded and I cannot guarantee its correctness.
4. Open code/demo.
